# recordme_followme
Record me follow me is a Technology
that aims to record a somebody passing an emotional
 or standard video message while he is not static

The drone will be registering both sound and scene images.
Our challenge is to adapt to higher speeds
like making a drone follow somebody while riding a bicycle 
or doing sky.
emotions would be shared not just with the image but with the 
actual voice

As the main goal is defined several other
algorithms including path planning will be 
combined to this package ,making it a 
complete package.

Using a smartphone, The mobilenet
model will be running and commands would 
be sent to the drone through the sdk.

The project will be implemented first on the ardrone 2.0
but the Goal is to make it work o, even smaller drones such as 
DJI tello using a simple app on a smartphone.
